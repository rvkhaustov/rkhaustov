The parser will make every attempt to create a clean parse from the HTML you provide, regardless of whether the HTML is well-formed or not. It handles:

unclosed tags (e.g. Lorem Ipsum parses to Lorem Ipsum)
 implicit tags (e.g. a naked <td>Table data</td> is wrapped into a <table><tr><td>...)
reliably creating the document structure (html containing a head and body, and only appropriate elements within the head)
